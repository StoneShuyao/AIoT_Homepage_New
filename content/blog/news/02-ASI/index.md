  The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a vast array of devices and systems that interact with the physical world through sensing, communication, and computing capabilities. Recent advancements in deep learning and mobile technologies have ushered in a new era of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) systems that merge advanced artificial intelligence with IoT technologies. AI-based voice assistants like Amazon Alexa have transformed the way users interact with their homes, while smart health systems hold the promise of proactive, individualized care for the elderly and people with disabilities. Autonomous driving is also expected to revolutionize transportation and significantly reduce traffic-related fatalities. However, as AIoT technologies continue to evolve and become more widespread, they present several sustainability, ethics, and privacy challenges.

  ASI-AIoT 2023 will bring together renowned researchers and scientists to Hong Kong to share their research experiences and provide insightful perspectives on the future of AIoT technologies. The event will also focus on strategies for future industrial collaborations, technology transfer, and real-world deployment of AIoT technologies in Hong Kong and beyond.
