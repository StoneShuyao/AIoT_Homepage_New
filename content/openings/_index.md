[The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html) is a world-leading research university. CUHK has the largest campus of all higher education institutions in Hong Kong. Its scenery campus is located in Shatin, which is 25 minutes from Shenzhen by train. Next to the CUHK campus is the Science and Technology Park - the home to a few hundred high-tech start-ups and major companies offering many research collaboration and internship opportunities. The [Department of Information Engineering (IE)](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk) was founded by Nobel Laureate and former president of CUHK Prof. Charles K. Kao in 1989. IE has gained a world-wide reputation for its leading-edge research and high impact on industries, including setting up the first Internet connection linking HK to the world and being the birthplace of Network Coding (now a major research area in information theory and communication) and a few high-profile high-tech start-ups such as SenseTime.

The Embedded AI and IoT (AIoT) Lab is conducting world-class research at the intersection between systems, networking, and embedded AI. The lab has developed new technologies at the frontier of smart cities, mobile health, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), wireless networks, security and privacy. The director, Prof. Guoliang Xing, is an IEEE Fellow, and has received a number recognitions including the Withrow Distinguished Scholar Award from Michigan State University and Faculty CAREER Award from the US National Science Foundation. The AIoT lab has received two Best Paper Awards and five Best Paper Nominations from prestigious international conferences including ICNP, IPSN, and PerCom.
