description: >
  Applications of real-time AI assisted by the roadside infrastructure include autonomous driving, adaptive control of traffic lights, smart parking garage, real-time tracking of public vehicles, public safety, smart power grid etc. In this project, we will develop key real-time AI technologies for smart cities, including real-time multi-hop vehicular networks based on BATS codes, real-time scheduling for concurrent deep learning tasks, collaborative AI algorithms for lamppost-vehicle information fusion, and lightweight virtualization and task orchestration for lamppost-assisted autonomous driving.
