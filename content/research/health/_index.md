  We have developed a cutting-edge smart sensing system for early AD diagnosis and intervention. We have developed a sensor box containing multiple non-invasive sensors placed in living/bedroom rooms to capture various behavioral data like basic motion/social activities. The collected data is then analyzed using state-of-the-art AI algorithms to identify potential signs and stages of AD. Our smart sensing system has already been deployed in the homes of more than 60 normal elderly individuals and those with AD.
