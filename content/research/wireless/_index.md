  We have built a high-precision indoor social contact tracking system to support fine-grained infectious disease transmission modeling and control. The system combines various communication and sensing technologies, including Ultra-wideband and Bluetooth Low Energy, to provide accurate distance information. In infrastructure-free scenarios, AI algorithms assist in planning communication to achieve rapid deployment of the system. The system will be deployed in real-world settings such as hospitals and office buildings, and the data collected will be used to support fine-grained infectious disease transmission modeling and intervention.

### **Power Consumption of NB-IoT in the Wild**

   We develop NBScope - the first hardware NB-IoT diagnostic tool that supports fine-grained fusion of power and protocol traces. We then conduct a large-scale field measurement study consisting of 30 nodes deployed at over 1,200 locations in 3 regions during a period of three months. We then explore the optimization of NB-IoT base station settings on a software-defined eNodeB testbed, and suggest several important design aspects that can be considered by future NB-IoT specifications and chipsets.

### **Wireless Coexistence in Open Radio Spectrum: Curses and Blessings**

  We are among the first to systematically study the issue of co-existence between Wi-Fi and ZigBee networks. We also demonstrate the significant benefits of exploiting cross-technology wireless interference. We develop new systems that utilize ZigBee radios to identify the existence of Wi-Fi networks which have been used for WiFi discovery on mobile devices and time synchronization in large ZigBee networks.
