 - **Bio:** Welcome to CUHK AIoT Lab! Our research lies at the interface between systems, embedded AI, data/information processing algorithms, and domain sciences, with a focus on interdisciplinary applications in health, environment, and energy. Our lab develops new technologies at the frontier of mobile health, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), wireless networks, security and privacy. Several mobile health technologies developed in our lab have been commercialized and used by thousands of users. Prof. Xing led the development and field deployment of several large-scale cyber physical systems, including 20+ seismic monitoring systems on two live volcanoes in South America. He has been awarded 10 NSF grants, including 4 large multi-institute grants from major NSF interdisciplinary programs (Smart and Connected Health, Cyber Physical Systems, Cyber-Innovation for Sustainability Science and Engineering, and Cyber-Enabled Discovery and Innovation). Prof. Xing has served as the Steering Committee member, General Chair, and TPC Chair of several international conferences including IPSN – IEEE/ACM’s premier conference on information processing in sensor systems.
